"""growlpeat - Growl repeater. Listens for Growl notifications and re-broadcasts them to a list of Growl clients.

<http://github.com/joshdick/growlpeat>

+-------------+
| INFORMATION |
+-------------+

This script can be used in place of Growl's built-in "Forward notifications to other computers" feature to ensure
that a Growl notification can be consistently repeated to a group of computers running Growl clients, regardless of
the power/network state of any of the computers in the group. This is desirable over relying on any single computer
in the group to do forwarding.

growlpeat is known to work with Python 2.6.1 and later.

For more information about Growl, visit <http://growl.info>.

+-------+
| USAGE |
+-------+

growlpeat expects a configuration file, growlpeat.properties, to be present in the same directory as growlpeat.
Please make a copy of the included growlpeat.properties.dist file and name it growlpeat.properties.
Then, edit growlpeat.properties accordingly - the file contains explanations for each setting.

After that, simply execute growlpeat.py from the command line. growlpeat will start listening for Growl registration/
notification messages. If a received message uses the configured password, it will be re-broadcasted to each of the
configured Growl clients.

In order for growlpeat to function, you must configure your Growl-enabled applications to register to the computer
that growlpeat is running on, using the configured password. Whenever you add new Growl clients to growlpeat.properties
(including the initial time), you must re-register your Growl-enabled applications with growlpeat so that all of your
Growl clients become aware of the registration.
